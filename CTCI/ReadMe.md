## The Interview Process

Interview performance is usually placed upon:

- Analytical Skills: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was the solution? How long did it take? If you had to design / architect it, did you structure the problem well and think through trade offs?
- Coding Skills: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonably code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good styles?
- Technical knowledge / computer science fundamentals: Do you have strong fundamentals
- Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? How are your projects? Have you shown drive, initative and other important factors?
- Culture fit / communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and teams

- **Most interviews aren't alright with pseudocode for whiteboard interviews**

### How Questions are Selected

- Interviewers are usually given free reign on what questions to use "Questions at google" aren't going to give specifics as they can choose whatever question they want on a given day.
- Most of the qeustions they ask don't change over years
- Some companies focus on algorithms whilst others focus on knowledge based ones.

## Behind The Scenes

### Microsoft Interview

- MS wants smart people
- On the day you'll have a short interview with recruiter which will give you a sample question, prepping you not grilling you. Just easing you in before your "real interview" starts
- Be nice, they can be best advocate
- During the day you'll do 4-5 interviews w/ 2 different teams

#### Definitely prepare

- "Why do you want to work for microsoft"
  - I've been using MS products for a long time. I like how they've managed to create a cosnsitent environment on desktops that are universally excellent. I've been using VS recently to learn programming and it's XYZ is excellent

#### What's Unique

- You'll only reach the hiring manager if you've done well
- Microsoft gives team more individual controls since the product is diverse

### Amazon Interview

- Amazon starts with:
  - A phone screen for a specific team
  - If you have 2 or more they aren't convinced or being considered for a different team
  - After screens you fly to the office
    - 4-5 interviews with two teams based on interview
    - Code on a whiteboard & some interviewers will stress other skills
      - Recruiters will have a code on a whiteboard and some interviewers will stress other skills
    - The "bar raiser" interviewer is charged with keeping the bar high. They attend special training and will interview candidates outside the group. This guy is an expert in grilling.

#### Prepare

- Amazon cares about scale. Prepare about scalability. Don't need distributed system but check system design & scalability

#### What's unique

- Bar raiser is brought from a different team to keep the bar high. **need to improve bar raiser & hiring manager**

### Google Interview

- First phone interview
- Then google doc / whiteboard
- On site is 4-6 people will be a lunch interviewer
  - Interviewer feedback is confidential so you start at a blank slate
- Not focuses or no structure, just do whatever they like
- Written feedback is submitted to a hiring comittee (HC)
- To an extend an offer HC wants to see at least one "enthuastic endorser" i.e 3.6 vs all 3.1s
- You don't need to excell
- If you're recommended, your packet will go to a compensation offer and then management comittee

#### Prepare

- Cares about scalability
- Strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills

#### What's different

- Hiring comitteee makes final decision. This is rarely rejected by google execs

### Apple Interview

- To do later

#### Facebook Interview

- To do later

#### Palantir Interview

- To do later

## Special Situations

### Startups

#### Application Process

- Remember to spend time doing planning on the algorithm before jumping into code
