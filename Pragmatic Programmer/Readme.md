Read this book if you want to:

- Fight software rot
- Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge
- Write flexible, dyanmic & adaptable code
- Avoid programming by coincidence
- Bullet proof your code with contracts, assertions and exceptions
- Capture real requirements
- Test ruthlessly and effective
- Delight your users
- Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and
- Make your developments more precise with automation

## Foreword

- In this book it explores how programmers get smart. All programmers focus on details but they also paid attention to what they're doing and then they tried to do it better.

- Imagine two people one person thinks I could spend time programming instead. And another who spends time thinking what they could do in the meeting and how to automate them. They'e programming

- So imagine these guys in a few years. Pretty soon they would have a collection of solutions. Now imagine their work in a few years with them discarding the bad ones. That defines _pragmatic_. Now imagine them in a year or two, that information is a gold mine.

## Preface

- This will help you become a better programmer. Help as an individual regardless of circumstance. This isn't theoretical but works on practice topics on using experience to make informed decisions.

- The word **pragmatic** comes from the word "skilled in business

- Programming is a craft

  - Part listener
  - Part advisor
  - Part interpreter
  - Part dictator

- You capture elusive requirements and finding a way expressing them so a mere machine can do it
- You document it so others can understand it
- You engineer it so that others can build on it

- There is no best best solution, there can only be solutions that are more appropriate to a solution
- Pragmatism comes in where you shouldn't be wedded to any technology, but have a broad enough bg and experience to allow you to choose a good solution based on a situation.
- Your background stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science, and your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects.

## What makes a pragmatic programmer?

- Each developer is unique with individual strengths and weaknesses, preferences1 and dislikes. Over time they'll craft their own personal environment. That environment will reflect their individuality, however if you're pragmatic you'll share these:

  - Early adopter / fast adapter: Instinct for technology and love trying things out. When given something new you can quickly intergrate it with the rest of your technology
  - Inquisitive: You tend to ask questions. Each of these questions will build your knowledge over the years
  - Critical thinker: You rarely take things without getting the facts. When colleagues say 'because the way it's done' you smell challenge
  - Realistic - you try to understand the underlying nature of each problems you face. This realism gives you a good feeling for how diffcult things are and how long they'll take
  - Jack of all trades: You try hard to be familar with a broad range of technologies and work to keep abreast of new developments. Whilst your job requires you to be a specialist you'll be always able to move on to new challenges or areas

- Tip 1: Care about your craft - we fieel there's no point about developing in software unless you're doing it well

- Think about your work! In order to be pragmatic, we challenge you what you're doing it. This is not a one time audit, its ongoing with every decision you make. Never run on autopilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time.

The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of
continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as you and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings
